# BeansBay - Recommendation System using Machine Learning

BeansBay is a platform for buying and selling Indonesian coffee beans. It utilizes machine learning models for recommendation and finding similar products. The recommendation system and similar product models are built using TensorFlow, ensuring accurate and personalized recommendations for users.

## Dataset
In **BeansBay**, two machine learning models are used, namely for system recommendations and for similar products. In both models, two different datasets are used, namely coffee_products and coffee_consumers. Both models use **TensorFlow** to make accurate recommendations. Meanwhile, the dataset used can be accessed at the following link.

- produk_kopi : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR0m9FjHszfjZh1ei--UGZnUivJQSoU2-pRdGrWNHaXtqBWneZNbEdoZg_cOZ87gJTDjJMtGcGphED_/pubhtml?gid=165615979&single=true
- konsumen_kopi : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR0m9FjHszfjZh1ei--UGZnUivJQSoU2-pRdGrWNHaXtqBWneZNbEdoZg_cOZ87gJTDjJMtGcGphED_/pubhtml?gid=2012083633&single=true

Both of these datasets are secondary datasets.

## Usage
To use the machine learning models and implement the recommendation system and similar product features in your own application, follow these steps:
- Download the produk_kopi and konsumen_kopi datasets from the provided links.
- Preprocess and clean the datasets according to your application's requirements.
- Customize the downloaded linked dataset links by integrating them in the #Load The Data section of each code.
- Build and train the machine learning models in section #Data Train
- Incorporate the trained models into your application to provide personalized recommendations and find similar products based on user preferences.

Please note that the dataset links provided are subject to change, and it's recommended to download and store the datasets locally for smooth integration with your application.
