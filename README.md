<p align="left">According to the International Coffee Organization (2023), Indonesia is the fourth largest coffee producer in the world. Currently, the coffee business is increasingly trending among the public, including MSME players. However, marketing coffee beans for several coffee shops is still difficult to do. So, in this team we create mobile application named BeansBay. BeansBay is such an e-commerce as a platform for buying and selling quality coffee beans is one of the solutions. With BeansBay, it is hoped that the people of Indonesia can buy and sell easily and efficiently, as well as increase knowledge regarding some good coffee beans to boost the economy.</p>

<h3 align="left">Steps to Deploy Firestore to Cloud Functions</h3>

**Step 1:** Create a Firebase Project
- Open the Firebase console and create a new project.
- Make sure the Firebase project is connected to your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. This enables you to leverage the resources and services provided by GCP.

**Step 2:** Access the Project Directory
- Open the project directory of your Firebase project on your local machine. This directory contains the files and code for your Firebase project.

**Step 3:** Install Firebase CLI
- Install the Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) using npm, which is a package manager for Node.js.
- Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- To install the Firebase CLI, open your command-line interface and execute the following command: `npm install -g firebase-tools`.
- This command will globally install the Firebase CLI, allowing you to use it from any directory on your machine.

**Step 4:** Login to Firebase
- Log in to Firebase using your Google Account by running the command: `firebase login`.
- This command will open a browser window where you can authenticate with your Google Account.
- Logging in establishes a connection between your local computer and Firebase, granting you access to your Firebase project.

**Step 5:** Initialize the Firebase Project
- After logging in, navigate to your app's directory in the command-line interface.
- From there, initialize a new Firebase project by executing the command: `firebase init`.
- The `firebase init` command will guide you through the process of configuring your project directory and setting up Firebase products.
- During the initialization, you will be prompted to select the Firebase product you want to use (in this case, Firestore) and configure and deploy Firestore to Cloud Functions.
- Make sure to choose the default Firebase project that you created earlier.

**Step 6:** Deploy Firestore to Cloud Functions
- Once the project is initialized, you can deploy Firestore to Cloud Functions by running the following command from your project directory: `firebase deploy --only functions`.
- This command will deploy your Firestore functions to the cloud, making them accessible and ready to be triggered by events.
