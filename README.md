<p align="left">According to the International Coffee Organization (2023), Indonesia is the fourth largest coffee producer in the world. Currently, the coffee business is increasingly trending among the public, including MSME players. However, marketing coffee beans for several coffee shops is still difficult to do. So, in this team we create mobile application named BeansBay. BeansBay is such an e-commerce as a platform for buying and selling quality coffee beans is one of the solutions. With BeansBay, it is hoped that the people of Indonesia can buy and sell easily and efficiently, as well as increase knowledge regarding some good coffee beans to boost the economy.</p>

<h3 align="left">Deploying API to Google Cloud</h3>

1. Create a Google Cloud Project:
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) and create a new project.
   - Provide a unique name for your project and select the desired organization and billing account.

2. Enable the Firestore API:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the API Library.
   - Search for "Firestore API" and click on it.
   - Click the "Enable" button to enable the Firestore API for your project.

3. Create a Firestore Database:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to the Firestore section.
   - Click on "Create database" to create a new Firestore database.
   - Select the location for your database and choose the security rules (e.g., locked mode or test mode) as per your requirements.
   - Click on "Next" and then "Enable" to create the database.

4. Generate Firestore Credentials:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to the "IAM & Admin" section.
   - Select "Service Accounts" and click on "Create Service Account".
   - Provide a name for the service account and select the desired roles (e.g., Firestore Admin, Cloud Functions Developer).
   - Click on "Create" to generate the service account.
   - Once the service account is created, click on the "Create Key" button to generate a JSON key file.
   - Download the JSON key file and keep it secure. This file will be used to authenticate your API requests.
