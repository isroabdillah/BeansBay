<p align="left">According to the International Coffee Organization (2023), Indonesia is the fourth largest coffee producer in the world. Currently, the coffee business is increasingly trending among the public, including MSME players. However, marketing coffee beans for several coffee shops is still difficult to do. So, in this team we create mobile application named BeansBay. BeansBay is such an e-commerce as a platform for buying and selling quality coffee beans is one of the solutions. With BeansBay, it is hoped that the people of Indonesia can buy and sell easily and efficiently, as well as increase knowledge regarding some good coffee beans to boost the economy.</p>
